oldskool dos / amiga cracktro scroller fonts, ripped and converted to .gif

Most are from [Daniel Guldkrans](http://www.algonet.se/~guld1/freefont.htm)'s collection.  Thanks. I wget'ed the entire collection, now preserved and freely available.

I plan to remove Daniel's watermarks and add transparency, eventually.
